# UNIFIED-MENTOR_DATA-SCIENCE
As a Data Science Intern with Unified Mentor, I contributed to end-to-end analytics projects: data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model development (classification/regression), and deployment-ready notebooks. Focused on reproducible code, clear visualizations, and measurable impact.
